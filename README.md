# Mask-GRPO

### Update on Dec 18th:

We release the training code. Usage:
```
accelerate launch --num_processes=16 --num_machines=${NNODES} \
--machine_rank=${NODE_RANK} \
--main_process_ip=${MASTER_ADDR} \
--main_process_port=${MASTER_PORT} Mask_GRPO_train.py config=configs/Mask_GRPO_train_512x512.yaml \
mode='t2i'
```

### Update on Nov 9th:

We release the inference code of our model on [GenEval](https://github.com/djghosh13/geneval)! Play our model freely!

To get start, we recommend that you first prepare the environment following [Show-O](https://github.com/showlab/Show-o), and save its model at your local.

Then, modify the first 4 lines in the main function of `code/geneval.py`, and run                  
```
bash code/geneval.sh
```
The evaluation process keeps the same with [GenEval](https://github.com/djghosh13/geneval).

We are packing our training code now. In fact some functions of training are in `code/models/modeling_showo.py`.

### Update on Oct 26th:

We released our [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/happyyifu/Mask-GRPO/blob/main/mycheckpoint.pth)!

We are packing our code now. We will release it soon.
